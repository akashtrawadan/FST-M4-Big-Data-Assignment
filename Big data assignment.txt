1. Create a directory in HDFS called input

>hadoop fs -mkdir input

2.Load the file data_quality_input.csv into this directory

>hadoop fs -put data_quality_input.csv/input

3.Understand the given input data and create hive external table for this

hive>CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE data_quality_input (
  CustomerID INT,
  name STRING,
  gender STRING,
  age INT,
  email STRING,
  Month_of_joining STRING,
  Mobile_No INT
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
   FIELDS TERMINATED BY ' ';

LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/hive/warehouse/data_quality_input' INTO TABLE data_quality_input;

4. List down the distinct month names in the given input

hive>SELECT DISTINCT month_of_joining FROM data_quality_input;

5.Calculate the total number of Male and Female in this data

hive>SELECT gender, COUNT(*) FROM data_quality_input GROUP BY gender;

6.Write down the role of these services in these above processes
a. HADOOP – NameNode: It is responsible for managing metadata information about HDFS.
b. HADOOP – DataNodes: It stores actual data in HDFS.
c. HADOOP – Secondary NameNode: It is responsible for creating checkpoints of the namespace information.
d. HADOOP – Resource Manager: It is responsible for managing resources in a cluster.
e. HADOOP – Node Manager: It is responsible for managing resources on a single node.

7. Take the records only the age between 30 and 50 and store it in HDFS

hive>INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/user/hive/warehouse/data_quality_output' SELECT * FROM data_quality_input WHERE age BETWEEN 30 AND 50;

8. Create the Database and table for the above results

hive>CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS data_quality;
USE data_quality;

hive>CREATE TABLE data_quality_output (
  CustomerID INT,
  name STRING,
  gender STRING,
  age INT,
  email STRING,
  Month_of_joining STRING,
  Mobile_No INT
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LOCATION '/user/hive/warehouse/data_quality_output';

9. Do the data export to transfer the data from HDFS to MySQL table

sqoop export --connect jdbc:mysql://localhost/db --username root --password root --table data_quality_output --export-dir /user/hive/warehouse/data_quality_output --input-fields-terminated-by ',';
